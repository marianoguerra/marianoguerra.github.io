    128M    node_modules

    $ ls -1 node_modules | wc -l
    740

# React Webpack Redux

```
    $ mkdir my-new-project && cd my-new-project
    $ yo react-webpack-redux

    "Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of
    bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just
    done by brute force and thousands of slaves."

    "I will contend that Conceptual Integrity is the most important
    consideration in system design. It is better to have a system omit certain
    anomalous features and improvements, but to reflect one set of design
    ideas, than to have one that contains many good but independent and
    uncoordinated ideas."

The best code is the code that's not there

The best tools are the tools that aren't needed

Dependencies are a liability

Remember when js people used to laugh at java frameworks, complexity and stack traces?

# Problems


* Redux doesn't go from simple to complex as you need it, it's full complex from day one

* Shallow cloning

  + Can introduce hard to track mutability bugs

* Actions Dispatched

  + imperative instead of declarative
  + plain objects with a type field, can introduce bugs due to typos

* Actions are dispatched throught the store?

  + What does the store have to do with actions?

* switch (action.type) :(

  + premature optimizer me: string comparissons everywhere

---

# Problems

* Centralized reducers don't allow to react to actions in other places

  + I guess "there's a middleware for that"

* If you use props and not state in redux, why do you use components and not just functions?

* Stringly typed actions

  + Don't have a centralized registry of all actions anywhere, can't introspect
  + Silent failured when typos are introduced

* reducers, I know naming is hard, but really?

  + also, thunks...

---

# Problems

* some middlewares (at least promise) introduces events that aren't named anywhere

  + explicit is better than implicit

* On code I've seen there are singleton stores returned from store modules
  + singletons are bad

* I've seen a pattern where actions are built and dispatched in their own functions

  + Why not dynamically generate those? why code them

* I've seen this: this.props.dispatch(fetchUser())

  + why the component knows how to dispatch an action and not the action itself?
  + I'm not the most OO guy in the world, but action looks like an object to me
    and dispatch seems to make sense to be there

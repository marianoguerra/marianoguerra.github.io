---

Convivial tools give each user the greatest opportunity to enrich the
environment with the fruits of his or her vision

--

Convivial tools encourage users to be actively engaged and to generate creative
extensions to the artifacts given to them

--

For Example Emacs

---

The goal of making tools modifiable by the user does not imply transferring the
responsibility of good tool design to the user

--

Convivial tools will remove from the maintainers the impossible task of
anticipating all possible uses of a tool and all People‚Äôs needs

--

Most systems belong to one of the extremes of the spectrum of conviviality

---

# General purpose programming languages

--

- Powerful

--

- But hard to learn

--

- Often too far away from the conceptual structure of the problem

--

- Takes too long to get a task done or a problem solved

# Beware the Turing tar-pit

# in which everything is possible

# but nothing of interest is easy

---

# Turn-key systems

--

- Easy to use

--

- No special training required

--

- Can't be modified by the user

---

# Beware the over-specialized system

# Properties of a Live System

From liveprog.org

---

# Live


Live programming systems give the programmer immediate feedback on the output
of a program as it is being edited

--

Replacing the edit-compile-debug cycle with a fluid programming experience

---

# Structure

‚ÄúStructure-aware‚Äù programming environments understand and preserve that
structure

--

Allow operations at the level of the structure, rather than at the level of raw
text

---

# Tangible

In the traditional view of programs, execution takes place behind the scenes,
and leaves little record of what happened

--

We are interested in programming systems that make execution transparent,
tangible and explorable

---

# Concrete

People find it easier to start with concrete examples and generalise afterwards

Sistemas Distribuidos, Para Que?

OOP es la solucion

Que conceptos definen OOP?

class: middle

Just a gentle reminder that I took some pains at the last OOPSLA to try to
remind everyone that **Smalltalk is not only NOT its syntax or the class
library, it is not even about classes**.

---

class: middle

**I'm sorry that I long ago coined the
term "objects" for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the
lesser idea.**

---

class: middle

**The big idea is "messaging"** -- that is what the kernal of Smalltalk
is all about.

---

The Japanese have a small word -- ma -- for "that which is in between".

**The key in making great and growable systems is much more to design how its
modules communicate rather than what their internal properties and
behaviors should be.**

Alan Kay ([Source](http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/017019.html))

    Actually I made up the term "object-oriented", and I can tell you I did not
    have C++ in mind.

Cual es el sistema mas escalable que conocemos?

Internet

???

En que version esta la internet?
Cuando es el proximo upgrade, cuando la reinician?
Porque hay cosas que pasan en software "chico" y no en internet?

Tandem's NonStop systems use a number of independent identical processors and
redundant storage devices and controllers **to provide automatic high-speed
"failover" in the case of a hardware or software failure**.

---

To **contain the scope of failures and of corrupted data**, these multi-computer
systems have **no shared central components, not even main memory**. Conventional
multi-computer systems all use shared memories and work directly on shared data
objects. Instead, **NonStop processors cooperate by exchanging messages across a
reliable fabric**, and software takes periodic snapshots for possible rollback of
program memory state.

---

**Besides handling failures well, this "shared-nothing" messaging system design
also scales extremely well** to the largest commercial workloads.

---

**NonStop systems have more often been bought to meet scaling requirements than
for extreme fault tolerance.** They compete well against IBM's largest
mainframes, despite being built from simpler minicomputer technology.

[Why Do Computers Stop and What Can Be Done About It?](http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/tandem/TR-85.7.pdf)

```
Fault-tolerant Execution                                    15

Software Modularity Through Processes and Messages          16
Fault Containment Through Fail-Stop Software Modules        16
Software Faults Are Soft, the Bohrbug-Heisenbug Hypothesis  17
Process-pairs For Fault-tolerant Execution                  20
```

---

As with hardware, the key to software fault-tolerance is to **hierarchically
decompose large systems** into modules, **each module being a unit of service
and a unit of failure**.

---

A failure of a module does not propagate beyond the module

---

The process achieves fault containment by **sharing no state with other processes**;

---

Rather, its **only contact with other processes is via messages** carried by a kernel message system.

---

Most production software faults are soft.

If the program state is reinitialized and the failed operation retried, the
operation will usually not fail the second time.

---

The process approach to fault isolation advocates that the process software
module be **fail-fast**, it should either function correctly or it should detect
the fault, signal failure and stop operating.

"OOP" -&gt; CORBA

Actor &lt;- Computer

Don't scale the shared state up, scale the computer down
(alan kay, each object is a computer)

---

class: center, middle

Shared memory no escala

class: center, middle

Leaky Abstraction: Network

???

networks and distribution leaks, so why don't consider them from the start
 + falacies, timeouts, two generals etc

# Erlang

Started with problems, built a solution

---

class: middle

# Erlang: Needs

* Fault Tolerant
* Higly Available
* Soft Real Time

---

class: middle

# Fault Tolerant

* Supervision Trees
* Process Isolation
* Lightweight Processes

???

+ Supervision Trees
+ Immutability (because shared memory and mutability is hard, easier to reason about code all info is local to the function, no spooky action at a distance)
+ Copy on msg passing (because shared memory is hard)
+ Internal state per process (per proc GC, a proc crashing doesn't corrupt another process state)
+ Preemptive Scheduling (because a process running slow shouldn't slow other processes, compare to nodejs/akka/cooperative scheduling)
+ Lightweight Processes (each thing that looks like a process should be a process, lightweight, can have millions, fault isolation)

---

class: middle

# Soft Real Time

* Preemptive Scheduling
* Per Process GC

---

class: middle

# High Availability

* Distribution

  + Location Transparency
  + Async Message Passing

* Hot Code Reloading

???

Distribution: because only way to HA is to have at least two computers, space
shuttle and apollo had everything 3 times usually

Async Message Passing: because real world and networks are async, can't do
distribution without

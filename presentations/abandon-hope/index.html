* The network is reliable.
* Latency is zero.
* Bandwidth is infinite.
* The network is secure.
* Topology doesn't change.
* There is one administrator.
* Transport cost is zero.
* The network is homogeneous.

# Two Generals Problem

Thought experiment meant to illustrate the pitfalls and design challenges 
of attempting to coordinate an action by communicating over an unreliable link.

---

class: center, middle

The Two Generals Problem was the first computer communication problem to be proved to be **unsolvable**.

# [FLP Imposibility Result](http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/a-brief-tour-of-flp-impossibility/)

This kind of failure detection is impossible in an asynchronous setting, 
where there are no bounds on the amount of time a processor might take to complete its work and then respond with a message. 

---

class: center, middle

Therefore it’s not possible to say whether a processor has crashed or is simply taking a long time to respond.

The FLP result shows that in an asynchronous setting, where only one processor might crash,

There is no distributed algorithm that solves the consensus problem.

# [Scalability! But at what COST?](https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/06/05/scalability-but-at-what-cost/)

Many published systems have unbounded COST 

(They never outperform the best single threaded application)

Others are orders of magnitude slower even when using hundreds of cores.

# [Google's Spanner](https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/01/08/spanner-googles-globally-distributed-database/)

It uses a combination of GPS clocks and **atomic clocks** as references

Able to give small confidence intervals (varying from about 1 to 7ms)

# [Google's Spanner](https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/01/08/spanner-googles-globally-distributed-database/)

An atomic clock is **not that expensive**: 
the cost of an Armageddon master is of the same order as that of a GPS master

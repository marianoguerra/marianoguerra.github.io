# Advent of Future of Code: Day 3

## Piano Fun with MockMechanics

Your task is to duplicate the [3 key piano of the MockMechanics tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuHP8JhCJvU).

[The specific part with the piano starts here](https://youtu.be/kuHP8JhCJvU?t=1415),
but unless you already know MockMechanics, you'll probably want to watch the
whole tutorial before that part to get familiar with all the concepts you'll
need.

If you are really ambitious, try creating the full piano like in this image,
you'll need these key frequencies:

- 261 277 293 311 329 349 369 392 415 440 466 493

## Tools needed

You need java installed, I tried using nix on ubuntu but got an OpenGL error,
installing java locally like this `sudo apt install openjdk-18-jdk` was enough
to make it work.

- Install Java if you haven't already
- Unzip [mock-mechanics-1.3-java.zip](https://github.com/marianoguerra/marianoguerra.github.io/raw/master/advent-of-future-of-code/days/day-03/mock-mechanics-1.3-java.zip)
- execute `run.sh`

**Note for Mac users**: it may fail to run with an OpenGL error too, if you can
find out why let the author know so he can document it for everybody else.

Hi!

Welcome to the 4th day of [Advent of Future of Code](https://marianoguerra.github.io/advent-of-future-of-code/)

## The Task

Today we are going to play with Wasp, a simple language for developing
full-stack web apps with less code. It allows to describe high-level features
with Wasp DSL and write the rest of your logic in React, Node.js and Prisma.

Your task is to setup Wasp and follow the [TODO App Tutorial](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/tutorials/todo-app)

## Tools needed

Check The official [Requirements](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs#1-requirements) docs

## Resources

- [Project Site](https://wasp-lang.dev/)
- [Project on Twitter: @WaspLang (be kind)](https://twitter.com/WaspLang)
- There will be a thread for this task in the **#share-your-work** channel at the [Future of Coding Slack](https://futureofcoding.org/community)

## Rule Reminder

You should try to setup the project and complete the task, you can go further if you want.

### Deliverable

- A video recording of you going through the whole process "thinking out loud"
- A transcription/notes/blogpost/twitter thread of the experience

### Do

- Tell what's your thinking process
- Explain when / where you get stuck, confused or frustrated
- Explain when something surprises you
- Explain if a thing reminds you of something else (for better or worse)
- Keep it positive and constructive

### Don't

- Say things you wouldn't say face to face
- Tell how it should be fixed
- Propose features or changes
- Tell them to rewrite it in Rust
- Highlight superfluous details that don't affect the task at hand (Unless requested by the project)

And above all, have fun!

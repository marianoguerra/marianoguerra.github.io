Hi!

You got this mail because you subscribed to [Advent of Future of Code](https://marianoguerra.github.io/advent-of-future-of-code/)/Review Jam

This is the first day of Advent of Future of Code, because of that we would love to get your feedback and experience with the format.

## The Task

Today we are going to be playing with nodes, wires and BMI Calculators using [Flowrunner-canvas](https://github.com/devhelpr/flowrunner-canvas):

- [BMI Calculator with Flowrunner-canvas Instructions](https://github.com/marianoguerra/marianoguerra.github.io/blob/master/advent-of-future-of-code/days/day-01.md)

## Resources

- [Project Repository](https://github.com/devhelpr/flowrunner-canvas)
- [Project Author on Twitter: @devhelpr (be kind)](https://twitter.com/devhelpr)
- There will be a thread for this task in the **#share-your-work** channel at the [Future of Coding Slack](https://futureofcoding.org/community)

## Rule Reminder

You should try to setup the project and complete the task, you can go further if you want.

### Deliverable

- A video recording of you going through the whole process "thinking out loud"
- A transcription/notes/blogpost/twitter thread of the experience

### Do

- Tell what's your thinking process
- Explain when / where you get stuck, confused or frustrated
- Explain when something surprises you
- Explain if a thing reminds you of something else (for better or worse)
- Keep it positive and constructive

### Don't

- Say things you wouldn't say face to face
- Tell how it should be fixed
- Propose features or changes
- Tell them to rewrite it in Rust
- Highlight superfluous details that don't affect the task at hand (Unless requested by the project)

And above all, have fun!
